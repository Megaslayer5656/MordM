Unlockable weapons of different types (Spears, Bludgeons, Blades, Staves, and Throwables)
Going to have unlockable cosmetics and playermodels
Proxy Chat (Bc it makes most games better)
Gonna have a decent amount of maps, some made by me


Minor Plans:

Leveling system with emblems for each level (Kinda like cod)
