PLANS:

Major/Overall Plans:
Gonna be a pvp gamemode with different gamemodes (FFA, TDM, CTF, KOTH, "Gun" Game, Juggernaut, ECT.)
Also include push based team modes (Frontline, Push)
Unlockable weapons of different types (Spears, Bludgeons, Blades, Staves, and Throwables)
Going to have unlockable cosmetics and playermodels
Proxy Chat (Bc it makes most games better)
Gonna have a decent amount of maps, some made by me
Gonna make a pause menu 

Shop system:
all weapons besides base weapons will be in the shop
there will also be cosmetics in said shop
some cosmetics will be given based on kills or matches won, not currency
all weapons will be currency based, and all will be low priced (although some higher than others) to keep the game balanced
Will have one free starter weapon for each type of weapon
leveling system will be added, each level giving 1000 of the currency
no weapon will be more expensive than 1000 of said currency (to keep balance)

Minor Plans:
Stats page
Leveling system with emblems for each level (Kinda like cod)
Possibly a perks system
make healthbar and scoreboard look better

Misc:
Private playtest starting soon
